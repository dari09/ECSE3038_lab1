# Lab 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following code was written for a lab assignment aimed at familiarizing 
students with Git, GithHub and Python and the development environment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Function 1 "parallel()" 

This function should return the sum of any range of varying resistor values assuming 
that they are connected in parallel. The sum is rounded off to 3 decimal places.

Feel free to use this program to cheat on any upcoming quizzes at your own risk.

# Function 2 "potential_divider()"

This function should takes two values as an argument, a number that represents a 
voltage supply value and a list of numbers of any length that represent resistance values of 
resistors connected in series. The function should output the voltage drop across 
each resistor in your resistor list.

Why did the voltage divider sign a peace treaty? It wanted to reduce the resistance!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Function 3 "temperature_check()"

This function accepts a single number for a patient's body temperature, and a single character, 
for the unit of temperature. The function should output whether the patient is hypothermic, 
hyperthermic or has normal body temperature based on the number passed to the function.
The second value passed as argument should tell the function whether the condition should
calculated in degrees celcius or degrees fahrenheit.
    
Why did the thermometer apply for scholarships? To get some degrees!
